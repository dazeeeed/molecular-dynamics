# molecular-dynamics
Simulation of molecular dynamics for argon atoms which are described by the laws of **Noble gas** which molecules interact with each other with the force of the Van der Waals. Van der Waals force is a distance-dependent interaction between atoms or molecules. Unlike ionic or covalent bonds, these attractions do not result from a chemical electronic bond; they are comparatively weak and therefore more susceptible to disturbance.


## Animation
Below is an example of the simulation for 5 atoms in the starting temperature of the system 150K.

## Real size particles
There is an option to show the atoms with their real size (radius is approximately 0.38 nm) shown below. Colors are used to distinguish their position.
